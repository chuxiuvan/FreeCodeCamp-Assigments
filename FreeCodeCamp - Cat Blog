        <h2> Where it all began... </h2>
          <p> <i> (I had to go through an old workchat from 2021 to retrieve the exact day I got her) </i> It was a clear day on 22nd November 2021, I was taking my mum to the doctors for her routine checkout on my day off work. Since it was during covid, we had to do our check-in outside of the clinic before we were admitted in. As I was conversing with the receptionist, a small figure appears out of the bushes - frail and so meek. This enfeebled creature curiously pads over to me, extends her neck to sniff me. A gentle caress to her head and I knew - its my turn with the cat distribution system.</p>
          <p> I felt like Mother Teresa (without the controversy), wanting to scoop this child into my breast and to protect her from harm and provide salvation. Her fur was patchy, body so frail, couldn't even meow - she used all her energy to walk over to me as if she knew I had the means to give her a life of comfort. Gone were her days of suffering. </p>
          <p> Well, she had to suffer for just a little longer. The staff at the clinic helped me out with stuffing her into a box so my family could take her to the vet. I told my dad that we got a cat and there was no room for negotiation. She did escape a few times while we were in the car and I felt so bad putting her back in. </p>
