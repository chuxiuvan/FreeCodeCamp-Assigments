        <h1> Video compilation page </h1>

        <p> This is part of my FreeCodeCamp exercise that involves teaching me how to embed videos onto a webpage with the iframe element. I am not particularly sure what kind of videos I should be embedding, so I will use my favourite videos that I refer to when I'm sad and need a pick-me-up :) I may or may not be showing my age with these types of videos. </p>

            <h2>DUde THaTs NoT A CaT! (Loud)</h2> 
            <p>Video is about 26 seconds long, don't think too hard on it. It's a kid screaming on the mic, pretending to be a cat </p>

            <h2> broken (pants) </h2> 
            <p> This artist completed this animation on a Nintendo 3DS app called flipnote. I cannot imagine how long it took to make such a small clip </p>

            <h2> Hungry Cat </h2> 
            <p> It wasn't until I had to decide what videos to use for this assignment that I realised that all of my videos chosen involved some sort of animal - whether it be the main focus or referenced in one way or another </p>
